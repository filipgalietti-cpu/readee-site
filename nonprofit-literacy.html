                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    READEE is a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving literacy outcomes for young learners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that every child deserves access to high-quality reading instruction, regardless of 
                    their background or circumstances.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>What This Means for Your Child</h2>
                <p>
                    As a nonprofit, our priority is your child's reading success—not profits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We partner directly with schools and teachers to provide supplemental reading support that complements what your 
                    child is already learning in the classroom.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Hidden Costs:</strong> Our program is designed to be accessible to all families</li>
                    <li><strong>Research-Based:</strong> We use proven literacy strategies backed by educational research</li>
                    <li><strong>Teacher-Approved:</strong> We work hand-in-hand with educators to ensure alignment with classroom instruction</li>
                    <li><strong>Community-Focused:</strong> We're invested in your child's long-term reading success</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>How We Support Schools</h2>
                <p>
                    We collaborate with teachers and administrators to identify reading skills that need extra practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our program provides targeted support in phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension—areas that are critical 
                    for reading development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents often ask: "How is this different from other programs?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is simple: we're not trying to replace your child's teacher. Instead, we provide additional practice and reinforcement to help 
                    concepts stick.
