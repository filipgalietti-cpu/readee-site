                <h2>What Makes READEE Engaging?</h2>
                <p>
                    We know that young learners need more than worksheets—they need lessons that capture their 
                    attention and make reading feel like an adventure, not a chore. Our program is designed to 
                    keep your child engaged through:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Short, Focused Lessons:</strong> Sessions are 10-15 minutes, perfect for young attention spans</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Activities:</strong> Children actively participate rather than passively watch</li>
                    <li><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> Kids know right away if they're on track, building confidence</li>
                    <li><strong>Progress Celebrations:</strong> We celebrate wins, big and small, to keep motivation high</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2>What Makes READEE Effective?</h2>
                <p>
                    Engagement is important, but results matter most. Our approach is grounded in the science of reading 
                    and proven instructional strategies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Systematic Phonics Instruction:</strong> We teach letter-sound relationships in a logical sequence</li>
                    <li><strong>Vocabulary Development:</strong> Children learn words in context, not just in isolation</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehension Strategies:</strong> We teach kids how to understand what they read, not just decode words</li>
                    <li><strong>Guided Practice:</strong> Students get support when they need it, building independence over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Spaced Repetition:</strong> Concepts are revisited to ensure long-term retention</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Three Key Areas</h2>
                <div class="skill-area">
                    <h3>📖 Phonics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your child will practice connecting letters to sounds, blending sounds into words, and 
                        recognizing common spelling patterns. This helps them decode new words independently.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-area">
                    <h3>📝 Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>
                        We introduce age-appropriate words and help children understand their meanings through 
                        context, pictures, and examples. A strong vocabulary makes reading more enjoyable and comprehension easier.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-area">
                    <h3>💡 Comprehension</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reading is more than just saying words on a page. We teach children to think about what they read, 
                        make connections, and answer questions that deepen their understanding.
                    </p>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>What Parents Notice</h2>
                <p>
                    Parents who use READEE with their children often report:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"My child actually looks forward to reading practice now"</li>
                    <li>"I can see improvement in how confidently they read aloud"</li>
                    <li>"They're starting to understand what they read, not just pronounce the words"</li>
                    <li>"The short lessons fit perfectly into our busy schedule"</li>
                    <li>"My child is bringing home better grades in reading"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Age-Appropriate Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Our lessons are specifically designed for early readers (typically kindergarten through 3rd grade). 
                    We understand that this is a critical window for literacy development, and we've crafted our 
                    content to match where your child is developmentally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each lesson builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity while maintaining 
                    that sweet spot between "too easy" and "too hard" that keeps children motivated and learning.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Questions Parents Ask</h2>
                <div class="faq-simple">
                    <p><strong>Q: How long should my child use READEE each day?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: We recommend 10-15 minutes per session, 3-5 times per week. Consistency is more important than long sessions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Q: What if my child gets frustrated?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Our program adapts to your child's pace. If they're struggling, we provide more support. If they're excelling, we gradually increase the challenge.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Q: Can I track my child's progress?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Yes! We provide feedback so you can see where your child is improving and where they might need extra support.</p>
