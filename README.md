# READEE

A nonprofit literacy program website helping young readers build strong reading skills.

## What is READEE?

READEE is a comprehensive early literacy program designed to support K-2 students in developing essential reading comprehension skills. The program works alongside schools and teachers to strengthen early reading through engaging, effective lessons focused on:

- **Phonics & Vocabulary**: Students learn key vocabulary and practice decoding
- **Text Comprehension**: Short "micro-checks" help students track what's happening
- **Critical Thinking**: Students answer why/how questions and explain their thinking

READEE complements—never replaces—classroom instruction, providing short, fun lessons with guided practice.
