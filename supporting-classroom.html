                <h2>We Work With Teachers, Not Against Them</h2>
                <p>
                    Your child's teacher is the expert on what your child needs to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    READEE is designed to support and reinforce what's being taught in the classroom—never to contradict or replace it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of us as extra practice time, similar to how sports teams have practice sessions in 
                    addition to games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The teacher provides the primary instruction, and we provide additional 
                    opportunities to practice and master those skills.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>How We Complement Classroom Learning</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aligned with Standards:</strong> Our content follows the same English Language Arts standards used in schools</li>
                    <li><strong>Reinforces Core Skills:</strong> We focus on phonics, vocabulary, and comprehension—foundational skills taught in every classroom</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Practice:</strong> We give children more opportunities to practice skills introduced by their teacher</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Timing:</strong> Use READEE at home when it fits your schedule, not when it competes with homework</li>
                    <li><strong>Builds Confidence:</strong> Extra practice helps children feel more confident participating in class</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What This Means for Parents</h2>
                <p>
                    You might wonder: "If my child is already learning to read at school, why do they need this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Great question! Here's the reality: classroom teachers are working with 20-30 students at once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even the best teachers can't provide unlimited one-on-one practice time. READEE fills that gap by:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Giving your child extra repetition of key concepts</li>
                    <li>Providing immediate, personalized feedback</li>
                    <li>Allowing practice at your child's own pace</li>
                    <li>Reinforcing what the teacher has already introduced</li>
                    <li>Building reading stamina and confidence</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Teacher-Approved Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    Teachers appreciate READEE because we:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't contradict their methods:</strong> We use widely-accepted, research-based strategies</li>
                    <li><strong>Support their curriculum:</strong> Our lessons align with what's being taught in class</li>
                    <li><strong>Save them time:</strong> Parents can help at home without teachers creating extra materials</li>
                    <li><strong>Show respect:</strong> We acknowledge that teachers are the primary educators</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Your Child's Reading Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Learning to read is like learning to ride a bike—it takes practice, support, and patience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The classroom provides the instruction and guided practice. READEE provides additional practice 
                    opportunities in a low-pressure environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When children get more practice:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Skills become automatic (they don't have to think as hard about sounding out words)</li>
                    <li>Reading becomes more enjoyable (they can focus on the story, not just the mechanics)</li>
                    <li>Confidence grows (they feel successful and want to read more)</li>
                    <li>The gap between struggling and proficient readers narrows</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-card">
                <h2>Working Together</h2>
                <p>
                    The best outcomes happen when teachers, parents, and programs like READEE work together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Teachers</strong> provide expert instruction and assess progress</li>
                    <li><strong>Parents</strong> encourage reading at home and use tools like READEE for practice</li>
                    <li><strong>READEE</strong> provides structured, engaging practice that reinforces classroom learning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Together, we create a consistent, supportive environment where your child can develop strong 
                    reading skills and a lifelong love of learning.

                <h2>Questions Parents Ask</h2>
                <div class="faq-simple">
                    <p><strong>Q: Should I tell my child's teacher we're using READEE?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Absolutely! Most teachers appreciate when parents are proactive about supporting reading at home. They might even have suggestions for how to make the most of it.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Q: What if READEE teaches something differently than my child's teacher?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: We use widely-accepted, research-based methods that align with common classroom practices. If you notice any conflicts, please let us know so we can address it.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Q: Will this overwhelm my child with too much reading practice?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Our short, engaging lessons are designed to feel different from homework. If your child seems overwhelmed, you can adjust the frequency. Quality beats quantity!</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Q: Is this a replacement for reading together at home?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: No! READEE provides structured skill practice, but nothing replaces the joy of reading together as a family. Keep doing both!</p>
